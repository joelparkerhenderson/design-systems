# Line chart

A line chart is a UI/UX component used to visualize data points over a
continuous range, typically displayed as a series of connected points or lines
along the X and Y axes. This type of chart is commonly used to track trends,
patterns, or changes over time, making it ideal for displaying time-series data,
such as stock prices, website traffic, or performance metrics. Line charts
provide users with a clear, intuitive way to compare multiple data sets or
monitor fluctuations, helping them easily identify upward or downward trends.
Effective line chart design includes smooth lines, clear axis labels, and proper
scaling to ensure accurate interpretation of the data.
