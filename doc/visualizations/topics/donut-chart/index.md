# Donut chart

A donut chart is a UI/UX component similar to a pie chart but with a circular
hole in the middle, creating a "donut" shape. It is used to represent
proportional data, with each segment of the chart illustrating a category's
contribution to the whole. Donut charts are effective for displaying parts of a
whole, such as market share, resource distribution, or percentage breakdowns.
The central hole can also be used to display a total value or additional
information, enhancing the chart's functionality. With its clean and visually
appealing design, the donut chart is often favored for dashboards or data
visualizations, offering clear, intuitive insights with the added benefit of a
modern aesthetic.
