# Scatter plot

A scatter plot is a UI/UX component used to display data points on a
two-dimensional graph, with each point representing a pair of values along the X
and Y axes. It is particularly useful for visualizing the relationship or
correlation between two variables, helping users identify trends, clusters, or
outliers in large data sets. Scatter plots are often used in data analysis and
statistical tools, allowing users to quickly grasp patterns or insights through
the distribution and positioning of the points. Effective design of scatter
plots includes clear axis labels, appropriate scaling, and optional data point
highlights to enhance readability and interpretation.
