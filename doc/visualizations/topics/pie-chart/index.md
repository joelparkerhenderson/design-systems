# Pie chart

A pie chart is a UI/UX component used to visually represent data as a circular
graph, divided into slices to illustrate proportions or percentages of a whole.
Each slice of the pie chart corresponds to a category, and its size is
proportional to the category’s value relative to the total. Pie charts are
effective for displaying simple, comparative data in an easily digestible
format, often used in dashboards or reports. A well-designed pie chart ensures
clarity by using distinct colors, labels, and legends, allowing users to quickly
interpret the distribution of values and grasp the key insights at a glance.
