# Design Systems

Design systems are collections of reusable components, guidelines, and best practices that help teams build consistent, scalable, and efficient digital products.

A design system includes both visual and code-based elements that ensure a unified user experience across different platforms, applications, and services.

## Design System Concepts

- **Style guide** – colours, typography, spacing and layout, icons, imagery, and branding.

- **Component library** – individual components (building blocks) such as buttons, forms, input fields, navigation bars, tooltips, etc.

- **Pattern library** – groups of components that work together to deliver a piece of functionality, for example, a navigation bar with a logo, links, search form, and action button.

- **Interaction guidelines** - button hover and click effects, transitions and animations, loading spinners, progress bars, and error, success, warning messages.

- **Internationalization and localization** - multiple languages and multiple locations, such as for showing words, numbers, dates, currencies.

- **Accessibility and usability standards** - colour contrast for readability, keyboard navigation support, and assistive technologies compatibility.

- **Code standards and documentation** - code components, when and how to use them, etc.

## Benefits

A design system is essential for digital products and services because it ensures consistency, efficiency, and scalability across systems:

- Consistency – it provides a unified language, ensuring that elements like buttons, typography, and colour schemes remain consistent across all platforms and channels.

- Faster, more cost effective, development and design – modular components can be reused from an existing library of elements which saves teams having to reinvent components for every new feature or product. Less time is spent on repetitive design and development tasks. This results in faster delivery of new products and features to users.

- Improved collaboration and efficiency - designers, developers, and product owners speak a common language which reduces miscommunication and streamlines workflows.

- Better user experience - consistent design patterns make interfaces more predictable and intuitive for users, ensuring that users don’t have to relearn behaviours across different systems and products.

- Accessibility - accessibility guidelines, ensure that products are inclusive and usable for all.

- Maintenance and scalability – a design system provides a single source of truth. Changes to design elements can be made globally rather than modified in multiple places. As products and services evolve, the design system scales with them, making it easier to add new features to existing systems.

- Quality – a design system would provide a foundation for measuring the quality of our product and services and serve as a reference point for managing and maturing UCD within our governance frameworks, for example, by adopting GDS style service assessments.

## Risks

The lack of a design system can lead to inconsistent user experiences, design and technical debt, challenges with maintaining and scaling products and services, gaps in communication between designers and developers, duplicated effort and cost in design and development work, and delays in getting new products, services and features into the hands of users.

[Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines)

Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines are for those who design, develop and distribute apps through Apple’s platforms (macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS and visionOS). The brand has additional guidelines organized by tech vertical, covering 28 additional branded elements such as CarPlay, HomeKit, Augmented Reality, iCloud and Wallet.

Under each platform, you can find guidance on app architecture, user interaction, system capabilities and visual design. Each section offers in-depth guidance on the intended use of each interface element and the rationale behind it. The goal is to ensure that apps offered through Apple’s platforms feel familiar and consistent to people who use them.

There’s also an extensive resource library with Sketch, Photoshop and Adobe XD files, which house a range of UI elements and specifications. You can also watch video sessions and tutorials on how to build intuitive, user-friendly experiences.

### Business specifications: Google Material Design

[Google Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/)

Going on a decade strong, Material Design has inspired many other companies to adopt their own design systems. It builds upon the metaphor of material, meaning that components are created to mimic the physical world and its textures (such as how objects reflect light and cast shadows). The idea is that when components behave like real-world objects, they become more familiar and predictable, which in turn reduces cognitive load for users.

Material Design is comprehensive and covers an array of topics ranging from design principles like color, typography, and iconography, to UI components–many of which are available as open source–to code documentation and other resources.

In 2018, Google introduced Material Theming, which extends Material Design principles to other brands, allowing designers to style components according to their brand’s needs. It added much-needed flexibility to the system, by offering ways to customize a single set of components. A series of hypothetical case studies, called Material Studies, demonstrate how components can be styled to fit any product, ranging from a finance app to an eCommerce app.

### Business specifications: Microsoft Fluent Design System

[Microsoft Fluent 2 Design System](https://fluent2.microsoft.design/)

First developed in 2017, Fluent is a collection of UX frameworks and UI components that share code, a unified design approach and a consistent set of interaction behaviors. The design system helps build coherent experiences across platforms, including web, Windows, iOS, Android and macOS. Last year, Microsoft announced Fluent 2, touted as the next evolution of the design system which enables more seamless collaboration and creativity.

Fluent 2 highlights five sensory elements (light, depth, motion, material and scale) using the physical world as its vocabulary. By taking inspiration from the physical world, Fluent guides the creation of experiences that feel as natural as possible. This can extend across devices that people use throughout their day (like tablet and mobile), plus experiences that are designed beyond a flat screen (such as mixed reality interfaces).

Fluent is an open source design system. It’s connected to a LinkedIn group where customers, partners, and a community of designers and developers can submit feedback to help improve the system.

### Business specifications: Lightning Design System by Salesforce

[Lightning Design System by Salesforce](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/)

Created nearly ten years ago, the Salesforce Lightning Design System is an excellent example of a design system that’s evolved over time. SLDS establishes principles and best practices for designing enterprise applications across the Salesforce ecosystem. Rather than focusing on pixels, it allows designers to focus on user experience, interactions, and flows, and helps developers focus on application logic.

Salesforce also pioneered the use of design tokens, which store visual design attributes (e.g., color, font size, spacing) that can be applied and updated across components and platforms. Rather than hard-coding individual values as visual designs evolve, design tokens ensure that changes are reflected across the entire product experience. They allow for a consistent visual system that's also much simpler to scale.

### Business specifications: Atlassian Design System

[Atlassian Design System](https://atlassian.design/)

Atlassian recently introduced their new design system, which is a combination of two older sites (Atlassian Design Guidelines and Atlaskit). Prior to introducing the new system, Atlassian’s design guidelines and code documentation were hosted on separate sites, which led to growing inconsistencies that reflected a design and code split.

With the new design system, Atlassian weaves content and code together from both sites so that designers, developers, and content designers have a unified destination to update, contribute to, and build upon. The new design system includes a section on brand mission, personality, values and brand promise. It also lays out guidelines for foundations, components, patterns, content and resources to help simplify the creation process.

### Business specifications: Spectrum by Adobe
